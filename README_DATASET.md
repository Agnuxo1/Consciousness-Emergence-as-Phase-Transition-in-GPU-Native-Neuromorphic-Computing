Dataset README — NeuroCHIMERA
=============================

This document describes the format and contents of the NeuroCHIMERA dataset bundles prepared for
publication.

Structure
- `dataset_1-2.zip`: Data related to experiment 1 (spacetime emergence) and supporting files.
- `dataset_3-4.zip`: Data related to benchmarks and experiment 2 (consciousness emergence).
- `dataset_5-6.zip`: Additional metrics, audit logs and raw outputs.

Each archive contains:
- `raw/` — raw simulation outputs (binary/state dumps)
- `processed/` — preprocessed CSVs and reduced features used in benchmarks
- `scripts/` — scripts to reproduce processing steps
- `README.md` — per-archive description and provenance

License
- The dataset is published under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 unless otherwise specified.

Provenance
- The datasets were generated by NeuroCHIMERA simulations with seed=42. See `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for
  details on the simulation parameters and reproducibility instructions.
