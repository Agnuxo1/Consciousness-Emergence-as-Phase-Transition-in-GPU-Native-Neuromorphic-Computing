Audit Checklist — Experiment 1 (Spacetime Emergence)
=================================================

- [ ] Reproduce environment using `environment.yml` or `requirements_experiments.txt`.
- [ ] Verify seed=42 is applied and random sources are controlled.
- [ ] Run `python 1-2/experiment1_spacetime_emergence.py` and capture outputs.
- [ ] Confirm output files exist (state dumps, figures, `benchmark_summary.json`).
- [ ] Verify fractal dimension calculation code and validate result `2.03 ± 0.08`.
- [ ] Cross-check energy numbers and confirm driven-dissipative classification.
- [ ] Compare outputs against `release/benchmarks/results-exp-1-*.json`.
- [ ] Validate documentation: input parameters, runtime, hardware used.
- [ ] Provide timestamped log and checksum of produced files.
